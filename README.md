# Lost and Found App

Welcome to the Lost and Found app! This project is designed to help users find lost items or return found items to their owners. The app aims to create a community-driven platform where users can post about lost or found items, connect with others, and facilitate the return of belongings.

## User Stories

- As a user, I can create posts about items I have lost or found to increase the chances of locating or returning the item.
- As a user, I can view posts made by others to discover relevant information about lost or found items nearby.
- As a user, I can sign in using my Google account for quick and convenient registration.
- As a user, I can access my profile to edit or delete my posts, giving me control over my shared information.
- As a user, I can click on a post to view more details about the lost or found item.
- As a user, I can use a button to initiate email contact with another user regarding a specific item.
- As a user, I can explore all posts made by a specific user.
- As a user, I can search for posts based on keywords like name, title, type, or description.
- As a user, I can use category filters to narrow down search results by category.

## Technology Used

I built the Lost and Found app using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and offers an excellent development experience.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality through static type checking.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data, posts, and relevant information.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up development with pre-styled components.
- **Vercel**: A platform for deploying web applications quickly and efficiently.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service for storing and serving images efficiently.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform to manage the project's source code.

## Features

- Create, view, edit, and delete posts about lost or found items.
- Sign in using Google for seamless authentication.
- Manage profile information and post history.
- Detailed view for each post, providing comprehensive item information.
- Initiate email contact with other users regarding specific items.
- Explore all posts by a particular user.
- Search functionality based on title, location, type, or description.

## Known Bugs

While I've done my best to ensure a smooth experience, bugs are a natural part of software development. I'm actively working to identify and address any issues. If you encounter problems while using the app, please let me know so I can make improvements. Your feedback is invaluable.

- Failure to load posts on first render(refresh or sign in required to fetch data)
- Sign in not always recognised
- Slow loading on mobile

## Project Management

I've used GitHub for version control, which has helped me track changes, collaborate with myself (and others in the future), and maintain the project's history. The development process has been organized using GitHub's features, providing a clear overview of tasks and progress.

Thank you for exploring the Lost and Found app! I hope it helps you reconnect with your lost items or facilitate the return of found items. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
